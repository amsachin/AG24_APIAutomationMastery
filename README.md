- ### Application code
  - The Tutorials application project used as an example application for the test code is a fork of https://github.com/bezkoder/spring-boot-many-to-many project that implements Spring JPA Many-To-Many mapping with Hibernate in a Spring Boot using @ManyToMany annotation
  - Refer https://www.bezkoder.com/jpa-many-to-many/#JPA_Many_to_Many for database schema and endpoints details
